# ECE661 Final Project Code
# Synthesizing Reality: A Comparative Analysis of GAN Architectures and Performance

This project delves into the comparative analysis of the traditional GANs, Wasserstein GANs (WGANs),
and Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN) to unravel the nuances of their generative
capabilities and performance. By harnessing the complexity of the CIFAR-10
dataset, we embark on a journey to not only construct and refine these models
but also to critique and quantify their performance through a multi-faceted lens of
evaluation metrics. Besides the former three variants of GANs, we seek beyond
and explore WGAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), Deep Regret Analytic
GAN (DRAGAN), and EBGAN aiming at broadening the generative scope of our models and
methods to improve the performance and training stability of GANs
